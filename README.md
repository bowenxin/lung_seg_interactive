# Interactive Lung Tumour Segmentation Software
An open source software for Interactive Lung Tumour segmentation based on **Matlab** GUI. The underlying segmentation algorithm was based on Random Walker while prior knowledge 
can be integrated into segmentation interactively using seeds. The developped tumor segmentation framework was used in research project for survival analysis of locally advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer based on CT images.

# Functions
1) CT Image Loading
2) CT Image Viewing
3) Tumor Segmentation with Interactive Seeds
